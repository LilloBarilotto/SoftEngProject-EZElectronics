# Informal description

EZElectronics (read EaSy Electronics) is a software application designed to help managers of electronics stores to manage their products and offer them to customers through a dedicated website. Managers can assess the available products, record new ones, and confirm purchases. Customers can see available products, add them to a cart and see the history of their past purchases.

# Context Diagram and interfaces

## Context Diagram

![Context diagram](uml/Context-Diagram.png "Context Diagram")

\<Define here Context diagram using UML use case diagram>

\<actors are a subset of stakeholders>

## Interfaces

\<describe here each interface in the context diagram>

\<GUIs will be described graphically in a separate document>

|        Actor         |   Logical Interface    |               Physical Interface               |
|:--------------------:|:----------------------:|:----------------------------------------------:|
|     Manager<br/>     |     PC, Smartphone     |         GUI (WebUI, Browser interface)         |
|    Customer<br/>     |     PC, Smartphone     |                      GUI      (WebUI, Browser interface)                 |

# Stories and personas
Persona 1: female,  an office administration responsible for the office tools.

Story:
She finds out she has to provide electronic devices for engineering team and for the office such as laptop, coffee
maker and etc. And she enters the website Ezelectronics and adds all the products in her shopping cart, and completes
the order by paying.


Persona 2: young, male, manager in Ezelectronics

Story:
He receives new stock of phones and he wants to add them to the website.
After login, he enters the product details and the price and updates the system

# Functional and non functional requirements

## Functional Requirements

\<In the form DO SOMETHING, or VERB NOUN, describe high level capabilities of the system>

\<they match to high level use cases>

|  ID   | Description |
| :---: | :---------: |
|  FR1  |             |
|  FR2  |             |
| FRx.. |             |

## Non Functional Requirements

\<Describe constraints on functional requirements>

|   ID    | Type (efficiency, reliability, ..) | Description | Refers to |
| :-----: | :--------------------------------: | :---------: | :-------: |
|  NFR1   |                                    |             |           |
|  NFR2   |                                    |             |           |

# Use case diagram and use cases

## Use case diagram

\<define here UML Use case diagram UCD summarizing all use cases, and their relationships>

\<next describe here each use case in the UCD>

### Use case 1, UC1

| Actors Involved  |                                                                      |
| :--------------: | :------------------------------------------------------------------: |
|   Precondition   | \<Boolean expression, must evaluate to true before the UC can start> |
|  Post condition  |  \<Boolean expression, must evaluate to true after UC is finished>   |
| Nominal Scenario |         \<Textual description of actions executed by the UC>         |
|     Variants     |                      \<other normal executions>                      |

##### Scenario 1.1

\<describe here scenarios instances of UC1>

\<a scenario is a sequence of steps that corresponds to a particular execution of one use case>

\<a scenario is a more formal description of a story>

\<only relevant scenarios should be described>

|  Scenario 1.1  |                                                                            |
| :------------: | :------------------------------------------------------------------------: |
|  Precondition  | \<Boolean expression, must evaluate to true before the scenario can start> |
| Post condition |  \<Boolean expression, must evaluate to true after scenario is finished>   |
|     Step#      |                                Description                                 |
